# Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
Terminology:

- Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class (or a base class or a parent class).
- Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class (or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
