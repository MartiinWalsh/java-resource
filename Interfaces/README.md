# Interfaces
Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how.

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. 
It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, 
thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

Unless the class that implements the interface is abstract, 
all the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class.
