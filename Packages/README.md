# Packages

Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming conflicts, 
to control access, to make searching/locating and usage of classes, 
interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier, etc.

A Package can be defined as a grouping of related types 
(classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access 
protection and namespace management.

### Example

In this example, the PackageDemo project is creating multiple classes and an 
interface. This package was added as a .jar artifact, seen in the 'out' folder.
Then imported as a library in the GameTest project.
