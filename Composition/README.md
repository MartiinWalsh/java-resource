# Composition
Composition is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.
This allows you to model a has-a association between objects.

This is being demonstrated in the Main class. The PC class is comprised of instances of the Case, Monitor and Motherboard classes.
There are also examples of composition within the Case and Monitor classes.
