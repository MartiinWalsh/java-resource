# Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the variables and methods together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

To achieve encapsulation in Java:
- Declare the variables of a class as private.
- Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
