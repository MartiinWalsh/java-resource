# LinkedList:

Similar to arrays in Java, LinkedList is a linear data structure. 
However, LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like 
arrays, they are linked with each other using pointers. Each element of 
the LinkedList has the reference (address/pointer) to the next element of 
the LinkedList. Every element is a separate object with a data 
part and address part.
